## Offline

As part of our mission to keep your data safe for the next hundred years, we want to ensure you have the right tools to handle worst-case scenarios.

The encryption algorithms involved in securing your data are completely open-source and non-proprietary, so you don't have to rely on us for your data to be safe and valid.

To further your protections against general disruptions in your network or ours, we've created a single page offline decryption tool that can run in any browser.
